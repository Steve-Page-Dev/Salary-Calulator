# Salary-Calulator
A salary calculator that accounts for native state taxes (Maine), federal taxes, and gives estimates for gross income and take home pay after taxes

This program was created as a way to help myself make better decisions and to plan batter financially. I typicall create this in each language that I've learned, however I've taken it beyond that with C++.  Initially, the program was extremely simplistic and only calulated gross wage for day/week/month/year, but I have expanded that to account for my state's taxes (Maine) and federal taxes to give myself a better idea of what I'll be working with day to day, week to week, month to month, and year to year.

I intend to further expand on this to inclue prompts for bills, groceries, and include other state tax rates to appeal to a larger audience.
